Description:
This is a c++ OpenGL project that is based on Tutorial 2 from http://www.opengl-tutorial.org.
The tutorial can be found here: http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-2-the-first-triangle/
This program draws random points on four different graphs using four different algorithms.

Features:
Displays four different graphs in one window.
Point locations and colors are randomly generated.
Graphs resize when the window is resized.
Points can be re generated by pressing keys 1-4.
Key 1 updates the upper left graph.
Key 2 updates the upper right graph.
key 3 updates the lower left graph.
key 4 updates the lower right graph.
The Esc key exits the program.

Requirements:
This program requires C++11 to compile.
glew
freeglut
glfw-3.0.4
glm-0.9.5.4

The script I used to compile this porject (compile.sh) is included.
You will need to modify the paths in the script before it will work on your computer.
